Some README statments include mathematical expressions which the Markdown in GitHub fails to support, so I put the README documents in jupyter notebooks which you can directly, **without any more operations**, open and view online in github(Well, sometimes it does need several times reloading...), but if you want to read it in your own computer offline, jupyter server needs to be set up beforehand. Don't worry, it is easy and there are huge number of tutorials to explain how to do it in the Internet. 

One efficient way is show below,
1. Download Python and setup. <https://www.python.org> pretty easy and just choose the default button and it will take less than 1 minutes.
2. Enter command line operation system(cmd), namely Terminal. And input "pip install jupyter", press "Enter" button in your keyboard and wait for another 1 minute.
3. If you success in the preceding 2 minutes, then you just need to input "jupyter notebook" in Terminal, press "Enter" button in your keyboard. Every thing is all right now.
4. What's more, you should enter the certain folder, or any parent folder of it, where you put the notebook in Terminal before inputing "jupyter notebook" in Terminal. Or you can just enter the folder and call for Terminal in the certain folder, which I believe more convinient.
